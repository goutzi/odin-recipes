            <li>150 g shredded phyllo dough</li>
            <li>40 g butter, + extra for the loaf tin</li>
            <li>230 g<a href="https://akispetretzikis.com/recipe/8839/pralina-fistikiou-aiginhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pistachio spread</a></li>
            <li>350 g chocolate ice cream</li>
            <li>30 g chocolate couverture, melted</li>
            <li>20 g pistachios</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the shredded phyllo with a knife, untangle it well with your hands to spread it out, and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat, add the butter, and let it melt.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded phyllo and lower the heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the phyllo for 7-8 minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until it is nicely golden.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and set the shredded phyllo aside to cool for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pistachio praline paste, mix them with a spoon, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove the ice cream from the freezer and set it aside for 10-15 minutes to slightly soften.</li>
            <li>Butter a 10x30 cm loaf tin, and then line it with parchment paper to cover the bottom and the sides, leaving quite an overhang.</li>
            <li>Add half of the shredded phyllo mixture to the loaf tin and spread it with a spoon. </li>
            <li>Add the ice cream on top and spread it evenly with the spoon.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the shredded phyllo, spread it evenly, and press it down with the help of the parchment to flatten the surface.</li>
            <li>Put the loaf tin in the freezer for at least 2 hours until the shredded phyllo is firm and set.</li>
            <li>Remove the loaf tin from the freezer and unmold the dessert by flipping it onto a cutting board.</li>
            <li>
                Cut the dessert into about 12 bars, drizzle them with the melted chocolate, sprinkle with pistachios, and serve.
            </li>
