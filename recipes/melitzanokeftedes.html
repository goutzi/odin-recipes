        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place a frying pan over high heat and let it heat up well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Without peeling the eggplants, cut them into small cubes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the olive oil and the eggplants to the pan, and mix them by shaking the pan. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Finely chop the onion and garlic, add them to the pan, and season them with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rub the thyme with your hands and add it to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sauté the veggies for 7-8 minutes, until they are nicely golden and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the pan from the heat, transfer the vegetables to a baking pan, and set them aside to cool for 15-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a second deep frying pan over medium heat, add the sunflower oil, and let it heat up well. Ideally, you want the oil to reach 180°C (350°F).                
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the boiled potatoes into a bowl, and drain them well to remove all the moisture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mash them with a fork until smooth, and then season them with salt and pepper.                
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the eggplants to the bowl along with the egg and oregano.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finely chop the dill, add it to the bowl, and mix everything together with a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crumble the feta cheese with your hands, add it to the bowl, and mix until it is incorporated into the mixture, making sure that it does not break down completely. The feta cheese should have no moisture at all.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the flour and mix again with the fork.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wear gloves and mix everything together with your hands until you have a smooth mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the 200 g of flour to a baking pan and set it aside to dredge the meatballs later. You can skip this step and fry the meatballs directly without dredging them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape the eggplant meatballs by taking a little of the mixture with a tablespoon and using a second spoon to give it an oval shape (quenelle).
            </li>
            <li>
                Dredge the meatballs into the flour, until coated, dust off the excess flour, and add them to the pan in 2-3 batches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry the eggplant meatballs for 2-3 minutes, turning them over with a slotted spoon until they are cooked through on all sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a baking pan with absorbent paper towels and use the slotted spoon to transfer the meatballs to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the frying pan from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the yogurt, lemon zest, salt, and pepper into a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finely chop the dill, add it to the bowl, and mix them with a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the eggplant meatballs with the yogurt sauce and fresh dill.
